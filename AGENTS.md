# Capsule

## Code Style

- Contract-driven development: Define the interfaces and data structures first, along with all test cases, before implementing the actual logic.
- Cohesion: All code should be split into cohesive modules that have a single responsibility and clear interfaces. Encapsulate unnecessary details.
- Minimalism: Choose to use a dependency if it reduces the scope of testing and quantity of code and as long as it does not compromise on performance and required capabilities.
- Traceability: all critical processes are verbosely logged so it is clear what happened after the fact and recovery can be feasible. Use INFO logs where necessary and DEBUG,TRACE aggressively for all critical processes. Logs should be structured and easily queryable. Instrument hot paths (e.g. major functions) for performance monitoring and debugging in production.
- Mocking: Use mocks for all external dependencies and critical internal processes. This allows us to have deterministic tests and easily simulate edge cases and failure scenarios that are hard to reproduce with real dependencies. Do not try to wire up two incomplete complex systems to mock each other.
